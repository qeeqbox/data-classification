## Data Classification
Data classification defines and categorizes data according to its type, sensitivity, and value. It helps ensure data confidentiality/integrity and makes it easier to access (Organizations usually design their data classification models and categories)

## Data Type
#### Content-based
Classification based on reviewing each piece of data and looking for sensitive information
#### Context-based
Classification based on metadata and environmental information (Indirect indicators of sensitive information) like the application or the person that created the document 
#### User-base
Classification based on a person's discretion and knowledge (User needs to know what's inside the document)
